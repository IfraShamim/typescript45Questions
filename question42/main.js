// Question # 42
// 42.Great Magicians: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 39. Write a function called make_great() that modifies the array of magicians by adding the phrase the Great to each magicianâ€™s name. Call show_magicians() to see that the list has actually been modified.
var magicianNames = ['David Copperfield', 'Houdini', 'Derren Brown', 'David Blaine'];
function show_magicians(magicians) {
    magicians.forEach(function (magician) {
        console.log(magician);
    });
}
function make_great(magicians) {
    return magicians.map(function (magician) { return "".concat(magician, " the Great"); });
}
var greatMagicians = make_great(magicianNames);
show_magicians(greatMagicians);
